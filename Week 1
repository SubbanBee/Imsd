a) Write a HTML program, to explain the working of lists. 

Aim : HTML program, to explain the working of lists. It should have an ordered list, unordered list, nested lists 

and ordered list in an unordered list and definition lists.

Description :In HTML, list tags are used to display a group of related items in a structured way. HTML provides 

different types of lists, each serving a specific purpose.

<ul> - Creates an unordered list (bulleted).

<ol> - Creates an ordered list (numbered or lettered).

<li> - Defines a list item inside <ul> or <ol>.

<dl> - Creates a description list (used for definitions or terms).

<dt> - Defines a term/name in a description list.

<!DOCTYPE html>

 <h2>1. Unordered List</h2>

 <p>This list uses bullet points:</p>

 <ul>

 <li>Apple</li>

 <li>Banana</li>

 <li>Orange</li>

 </ul>

 <h2>2. Ordered List</h2>

 <p>This list uses numbers:</p>

 <ol>

 <li>First Step</li>

 <li>Second Step</li>

 <li>Third Step</li>

 </ol>

 <h2>3. Description List</h2>

 <p>This list gives terms and their descriptions:</p>

1 b) Write a HTML program, to explain the working of hyperlinks using <a> tag and href, target Attributes. 

Aim: HTML program, to explain the working of hyperlinks using <a> tag and href, target Attributes. 

Description:

<a> (Anchor Tag):

Used to create hyperlinks to other web pages, email addresses, or files.

href (Hypertext REFerence):

Specifies the URL or link destination.

target Attribute:

Specifies where to open the linked document.

_blank opens the link in a new tab.

_self (default) opens in the same tab.

<img> (Image Tag):

Used to embed images in a web page.

src defines the image path.

alt provides alternative text if the image doesn't load.

width sets the image width in pixels.

1 c) Create a HTML document that has your image and your friend’s image with a specific height and 

width. Also when clicked on the images it should navigate to their respective profiles.

Aim: HTML document that has your image and your friend’s image with a specific height and width. Also when 

clicked on the images it should navigate to their respective profiles.

Description:

In this program, the concept of different types of lists in HTML is demonstrated. HTML provides multiple list 

tags that help in organizing and structuring information:

• <ol>: It is used to create an ordered list, where items are displayed with numbers or letters.

• <ul>: It is used to create an unordered list, where items are displayed with bullets.

• Lists can be nested, meaning one list can be placed inside another. For example, an unordered list can be 

included inside an ordered list, or vice versa, to show hierarchical data.

• <dl>: It is used to create a definition list, where <dt> defines the term and <dd> gives its description.

Program:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

 <title>My Profile and Friend's Profile</title>

<body>

 <h1>My Profile and My Friend's Profile</h1>

 <!-- My Profile -->

 <h2>1. My Profile</h2>

 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/your_profile" target="_blank">

 <img src="myphoto.jpg" alt="My Profile Photo" width="150" height="150">

 </a>

 <p>Click my photo to view my profile.</p>

 <!-- Friend's Profile -->

 <h2>2. My Friend's Profile</h2>

 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/friend_profile" target="_blank">

Output:


Write a HTML Program, in such a way that ,rather than placing large images on a page, the preferred 

technique is to use thumbnails by setting the height and width parameters to something like to 100*100 

pixels. Each thumbnail image is also a link to a full sized version of the image. Create an image gallery 

using this technique.

Aim: To write an HTML program that creates an image gallery using thumbnail images (100×100 pixels), where 

each thumbnail acts as a link to its full-sized version.

Description:

In HTML, the preferred way to display images on a webpage without slowing down the page is by using 

thumbnails. Thumbnails are smaller versions of the original images, created by setting the height and width 

attributes (for example, 100×100 pixels).

Instead of directly placing large images, each thumbnail is made clickable using the <a> tag, which links to the 

full-sized image. The target="_blank" attribute is used so that the full-size image opens in a new tab, without 

disturbing the current page.

This method allows users to quickly preview multiple images in a gallery format, while still being able to view 

larger versions when needed. It improves page loading speed, usability, and keeps the design clean and organized.

Program :

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

 <title> Thumbnail Gallery</title>

</head>

<body>

 <h1> Thumbnail Image Gallery</h1>

 <p>Click on any image to view the full-size version.</p>
